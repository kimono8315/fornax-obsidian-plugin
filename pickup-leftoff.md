Here's a pickup prompt for this project:

**PROJECT: Fornax Plugin for Obsidian - Telescopic Writing Assistant**

**Current Status:** Debugging drag-and-drop functionality in the telescopic UI. We've consolidated everything into a single main.ts file for easier development.

**What Works:**
- Plugin loads successfully in Obsidian
- Settings panel functional
- Telescopic UI displays with 3 zoom levels (Document/Paragraphs/Sentences)
- Document parsing works (splits paragraphs and sentences correctly)
- DOM elements are being created properly
- CSS styling is applied (red "DRAG ME" buttons are visible)

**Current Issue:** 
Testing if click events work on drag handles. User can see red "DRAG ME" buttons but we need to verify if clicking them triggers console logs and turns paragraph blocks red.

**Last Code Change:**
Modified drag handles to show "DRAG ME" with inline red styling for debugging. Event listener should log "Drag handle clicked!" and turn paragraph background red.

**Next Steps:**
1. Test if clicking "DRAG ME" buttons works (console logs + red background)
2. If clicks work, implement proper drag behavior
3. Add actual reordering logic that saves back to markdown file

**File Structure:** 
Single consolidated main.ts with commented sections showing where to split later. User has working package.json, manifest.json, etc.

**Testing Setup:**
User has test.md with 3 paragraphs, can see Fornax panel, paragraph view shows drag handles.

This should help me pick up exactly where we left off!
